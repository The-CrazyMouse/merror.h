# MERROR.H

Small little error handling library
Work in progress
I'm a student, i don't even know if any of this is rigth

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

To add it to your project, the only thing beside the static or dynamic library 
file is the header file `merror.h`.

Note: I haven't made test yet (will do it as soon as i got time),
but i will be using it in a small project so I will keep you up to date
